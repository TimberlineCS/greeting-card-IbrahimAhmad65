## Overview

This creates a webpage that shows an interactive greeting card.

## Compiling and Using

Clone the repository
Load the index.html file into Firefox.

## Discussion

My Primary problems occured with the `Press Me for a Snowy Suprise` button. First, I struggled to bind a function to the button, then I struggled with properly creating the snowflakes randomly. Once that was completed my primary issues occurred when I tried to load the `App.js` as a module, as this violated a CORS Policy, so I had to either host the website as a local server, or to load the `App.js` as a single file, which I chose to do.

## Testing

I have verfied that the santa picture moves at the correct rate, the Happy Holidays sign also moves properly. I also refreshed the webpage many times to ensure correct ornament placement when random and correct snowflake placement.

## Extra Credit

There was no extra credit

## Sources used

I used w3schools.com and stack overflow considerably. Aside from those, I used information from Notes Set 20-22
